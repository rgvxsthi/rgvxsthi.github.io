   System Presenting a Novel Way to Interact with Public Displays using Mid-Air Gestures
  description: |
   For this project, my team and I were tasked with researching and building an interactive system which focuses on touch-less, human-computer interaction, which led us to Lumos! The proposed system uses a <mark>Leap Motion</mark>, an inexpensive but powerful device capable of recognizing <mark>hand and finger-based gestures</mark>. Paired with technologies such as <mark>HTML5</mark>,<mark>Blender</mark>,<mark>Three.js</mark> and <mark>Node.js</mark>, we showcase different scenarios where the system is useful and allows a seamless yet interactive experience using different mid-air gestures.
