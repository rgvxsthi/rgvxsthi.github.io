   System Presenting a Novel Way to Interact with Public Displays using Mid-Air Gestures
  description: |
   For this project of the <mark>Designing Novel Interactions (INFO90003)</mark> course, my team and I were tasked with researching and building an interactive system which focuses on touch-less, human-computer interaction, which led us to Lumos!

   The proposed system uses a <mark>Leap Motion</mark>, an inexpensive but powerful device capable of recognizing <mark>hand and finger-based gestures</mark>. Paired with technologies such as <mark>HTML5</mark>,<mark>Blender</mark>,<mark>Three.js</mark>, <mark>Converse.js</mark> and <mark>Node.js</mark>, we showcase different scenarios where the system is useful and allows a seamless yet interactive experience using different mid-air gestures.

   For the <mark>Evaluating the User Experience (INFO90004)</mark> course, my group and I were asked to conduct a <mark>user evaluation</mark> and <mark>usability study</mark> of SparkPeople.com 

   10 participants were recruited after extensive screening (using <mark>semi-structured questionnaires and interviews</mark>) and were then asked to perform a variety of tasks to test the overall usability and layout of the website. While conducting these tasks, the reactions of the participants were tracked using the industry-grade <mark>Tobii Pro eye tracking device</mark> (the results of which were used to deduce heatmaps and eye-gaze data) and the <mark>Think-Aloud interviewing</mark> technique.
