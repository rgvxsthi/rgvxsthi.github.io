   This project, created as a part of the <mark>Web Information Technologies (INFO30005)</mark> course, involved the research and development of an online portal where users/restaurants could manage their food waste (in the form of ingredients that they no longer require, which could be picked up by other individuals who could make use out of the same).

   System Presenting a Novel Way to Interact with Public Displays using Mid-Air Gestures
  description: |
   For this project of the <mark>Designing Novel Interactions (INFO90003)</mark> course, my team and I were tasked with researching and building an interactive system which focuses on touch-less, human-computer interaction, which led us to Lumos!

   The proposed system uses a <mark>Leap Motion</mark>, an inexpensive but powerful device capable of recognizing <mark>hand and finger-based gestures</mark>. Paired with technologies such as <mark>HTML5</mark>,<mark>Blender</mark>,<mark>Three.js</mark>, <mark>Converse.js</mark> and <mark>Node.js</mark>, we showcase different scenarios where the system is useful and allows a seamless yet interactive experience using different mid-air gestures.

   For the <mark>Evaluating the User Experience (INFO90004)</mark> course, my group and I were asked to conduct a <mark>user evaluation</mark> and <mark>usability study</mark> of SparkPeople.com 

   10 participants were recruited after extensive screening (using <mark>semi-structured questionnaires and interviews</mark>) and were then asked to perform a variety of tasks to test the overall usability and layout of the website. While conducting these tasks, the reactions of the participants were tracked using the industry-grade <mark>Tobii Pro eye tracking device</mark> (the results of which were used to deduce heatmaps and eye-gaze data) and the <mark>Think-Aloud interviewing</mark> technique.
