   System Presenting a Novel Way to Interact with Public Displays using Mid-Air Gestures
  description: |
   For this project of the _Designing Novel Interactions (INFO90003)_ course, my team and I were tasked with researching and building an interactive system which focuses on touch-less, human-computer interaction, which led us to Lumos! The proposed system uses a <mark>Leap Motion</mark>, an inexpensive but powerful device capable of recognizing <mark>hand and finger-based gestures</mark>. Paired with technologies such as <mark>HTML5</mark>,<mark>Blender</mark>,<mark>Three.js</mark>, <mark>Converse.js</mark> and <mark>Node.js</mark>, we showcase different scenarios where the system is useful and allows a seamless yet interactive experience using different mid-air gestures.

   Bridging University Students together to Elevate their Education through a Mobile App
  description: |
   _Social Computing (INFO90007)_ involved my team and I to create an interactive system which would allow university students to showcase their assignments with their peers, enroll into mentorship programs with alumni students as well as provide them with the ability to manage university clubs and student societies from within the application itself. The rough mock-up of the application was designed in <mark>Adobe XD</mark>, whereas initial planning involved <mark>surveys and interviewing</mark> to understand the real requirements of university students based upon which, we generated <mark>user stories and customer journeys</mark>. The R&D phase also involved the development of multiple <mark>paper prototypes</mark> and <mark>user personas</mark>.

   Prototyping and Designing of a Personalized Navigation Guide for a Museum
  description: |
  The final project for _Fieldwork for Design (INFO90006)_ was to design and present a personalized navigation system using <mark>paper prototypes</mark>. We presented a prototype of a smartwatch which could be personalized according to the user's preferences (such as language and currency) and would provide them with a virtual map of the museum as well as the different artefacts and events going on. The report for this project can be accessed via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15J-25PnzBNUgjg4UoW8V6ONPtxDqw-XI/view?usp=sharing).

   An End-to-End User Study + UX Evaluation of Sparkpeople.com
  description: |
   For the _Evaluating the User Experience (INFO90004)_ course, my group and I were asked to conduct a <mark>user evaluation</mark> and <mark>usability study</mark> of SparkPeople.com. 10 participants were recruited after extensive screening (using <mark>semi-structured questionnaires and interviews</mark>) and were then asked to perform a variety of tasks to test the overall usability and layout of the website. While conducting these tasks, the reactions of the participants were tracked using the industry-grade <mark>Tobii Pro eye tracking device</mark> (the results of which were used to deduce heatmaps and eye-gaze data) and the <mark>Think-Aloud interviewing</mark> technique.

   Issued to me in 2016 by ImaginXP, this certification was my introduction into the field of _User Experience and Design Thinking_. For the final project of this certification, I conducted a UX overhaul of the Government of India's Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan Android application, the design report for which can be accessed through [this link](https://raghavsethi.xyz/assets/SwacchBharat_RaghavSethi.pdf).

   Some notable learning experiences that came out of this course are as follows:
    - How to plan, assess and carry out the <mark>design process</mark> for a new or existing system
      
    - The importance of <mark>Cognition, Ethics, Empathy and Perception</mark> when designing for a user
      
    - Different interaction, testing and designing techniques
      
    - Creation of <mark>mock-ups</mark>, <mark>personas</mark>, <mark>wireframes</mark> and <mark>user-stories</mark> as well as incorporating them into <mark>user journeys</mark>

##   In this paper, we present a novel approach about groups of similar factors which affect the degree of excellence in <mark>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)</mark> output.

##   It presents the top N factors which affect ERP practices using a precise feature-selection technique. <mark>Cluster Quality Analysis</mark> is used as a novel decision-supporting approach for obtaining an optimum feature set and the entire process presents a quantified measure about general ERP practices followed in the Delhi/NCR region of India. The open source <mark>Weka</mark> tool has been leveraged to design, analyze and perform the dicussed techniques.
