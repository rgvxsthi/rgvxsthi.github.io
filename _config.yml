  Hi there! My name is Raghav and I'm a budding UX Researcher. I have recently completed my Masters degree with a specialization in <mark>Human Computer Interaction (HCI)</mark> from The University of Melbourne (QS Ranking #3 in Computer Science).

  While my prior work experience is quite interdisciplinary in nature, a major part of it revolves around research-driven decision making. I'm a strong advocate for user-centric design and believe that it is important to understand and acknowledge the needs and frustrations of your customers to create memorable and easy-to-use experiences for them.

  If you have any questions or would like to consult me for business purposes, please do not hesitate to contact me. I can be reached via email - <a href='mailto:raghavsethi@yandex.com'>raghavsethi@yandex.com</a> or the provided social media handles. You can also have a look at my resume by <a href='rgvxsthi.github.io/assets/RaghavSethi_Resume_2020.pdf' target="_blank">clicking here</a>.
